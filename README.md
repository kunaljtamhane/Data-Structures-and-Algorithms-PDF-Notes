# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms Notes
This repository contains comprehensive notes (Codes are in other Repository named Data Structures and Algorithms Codes) on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and an Introduction to Java. These notes cover various fundamental and advanced concepts, making them an excellent resource for students, professionals, and anyone interested in computer science. All the DSA code examples are implemented in Java.
